# What is OSSHA

OSSHA is the the Open Source Smart Home Automation framework. 

# Motivation

OSSHA is a free to use home automation framework that removes the middleware and end-providers. 

Smart technology companies act as brokers for our personal information.
Their products feel more like they are designed to surveil than to provide a great user experience.
These companies have become economic powerhouses commoditizing our digitial lives.
OSSHA is focused on a consumers experience where technology enriches our lives without sacrificing our right to privacy and security.  

# Constraints

OSSHA will be created using off the shelf components and hardware. The intent here is that any product owner has a servicable device and community support. Democratizing the technology we consume by and for the consumers. 

The initial precidence enforced is:

1. A stack built around Elixir, Nerves, LoRAWAN, and the Raspberry Pi foundation.

A strong community already exists for these products, services, and frameworks. OSSHA is just a concerted effort comprised of their great efforts. 

# Aspiration

What is the 2 year vision?

- [ ] Centralized, reliable, and secure. For any aspiration below.
- [ ] Funtional "Opt in" Voice recognition ( including giving back to Mozilla's Open Voice )
- [ ] A Phoenix Live home controller with "plug in and run" functionality
- [ ] An open compeditive marketplace for home technology providers. I can't imagine what the next generation of inventors will come up with. So why not just give them a store front.
